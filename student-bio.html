        <p><lorem>Jamie Jones was born on August 19th, 1994 in Enterprise, Alabama. Raised by
            a military family, she moved around the world until moving to a city near
            Savannah, Georgia in 2009, where her father retired and bought a house. When
            Jamie turned 22 in 2016, she joined the Army. In 2018, she was medically discharged
            from the Army and moved back to Savannah. Once returning home, she began working at
            an animal hospital as a veterinary technician for a year before realizing she wanted
            to work in a career that allowed her to work remotely so she could travel the world.
            A friend of hers suggested web development, and after some research, she decided
            to take the big step in learning such a skill for her future career!</lorem>
